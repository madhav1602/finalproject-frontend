          Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the world—without building a mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic.

          We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards.

          <div className="text6">
          Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world.

          Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of Medium members who align with our mission. If you’re new here, start exploring. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you.
